The exercise project is to create a Virtual Task Management System using Express.js. This system allows users to create, update, read, and delete tasks. Tasks can be categorized, prioritized, and assigned to users.

Overview:
The Task Management System will have the following modules:

User management
Task management
Category management
Priority management
Task-User assignment
Steps:
User Management: Create an endpoint to add a user, get a user by id, get all users, update a user, and delete a user.

Task Management: Create an endpoint to add a task, get a task by id, get all tasks, update a task, and delete a task. Each task should have a title, description, category, priority, and assigned user(s).

Category Management: Create an endpoint to add a category, get a category by id, get all categories, update a category, and delete a category. Categories can be anything like "Personal", "Work", "Misc", etc.

Priority Management: Create an endpoint to add a priority, get a priority by id, get all priorities, update a priority, and delete a priority. Priorities can be something like "Low", "Medium", "High", "Urgent".

Task-User Assignment: Create an endpoint to assign a task to a user, unassign a task from a user, and get all tasks assigned to a user.

Use middleware for logging all requests and responses. Log the time of the request, the endpoint, the method, and the status code.

Implement data validation for all POST and PUT requests. Check that all necessary fields are provided and are of the correct type.

Ensure all DELETE and PUT requests first check if the item exists before attempting to delete or update it.

Implementation Guidelines:
Use express.Router to separate different modules into different files.
Use JavaScript data structures to store data. For example, you can use an object for storing data where the key is the ID of the item.
Use express.json() middleware to parse the body of incoming requests.
Use morgan for logging all requests and responses.
Use joi for data validation.
Testing:
Test your application using a tool like Postman or CURL. Here are example URLs for testing each endpoint:

User Management

Create a user: POST http://localhost:3000/users
Get a user by id: GET http://localhost:3000/users/:id
Get all users: GET http://localhost:3000/users
Update a user: PUT http://localhost:3000/users/:id
Delete a user: DELETE http://localhost:3000/users/:id
Task Management

Same as above but replace users with tasks in the URLs.
Category Management

Same as above but replace users with categories in the URLs.
Priority Management

Same as above but replace users with priorities in the URLs.
Task-User Assignment

Assign a task to a user: POST http://localhost:3000/assignments
Unassign a task from a user: DELETE http://localhost:3000/assignments/:id
Get all tasks assigned to a user: GET http://localhost:3000/assignments/:userId
Remember to replace :id and :userId with actual values.

For POST and PUT requests, make sure to send the data in the body of the request.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your application will be evaluated on the following criteria:

Code quality and organization.
Proper use of Express.js features, including routing, middleware, and error handling.
All endpoints work as expected and have proper error handling.
Data validation is correctly implemented and works as expected.
Logging middleware logs all necessary information.
This project aims to help learners understand how to create complex APIs with Express.js, use middleware, and implement data validation. It also provides experience in managing and testing APIs. Good luck!

Detailed Steps
Here's a more detailed version:

User Management
Create a User

Endpoint: POST /users
Payload: { "name": "string", "email": "string" }
Response: 201 Created with { "id": "generatedId", "name": "string", "email": "string" }
Function: createUser(req, res)
Error: 400 Bad Request with { "error": "Invalid user data" } for invalid or missing data
Get a User

Endpoint: GET /users/:id
Response: 200 OK with { "id": "string", "name": "string", "email": "string" }
Function: getUser(req, res)
Error: 404 Not Found with { "error": "User not found" } if user doesn't exist
Get All Users

Endpoint: GET /users
Response: 200 OK with [ { "id": "string", "name": "string", "email": "string" }, ... ]
Function: getAllUsers(req, res)
Update a User

Endpoint: PUT /users/:id
Payload: { "name": "string", "email": "string" }
Response: 200 OK with { "id": "string", "name": "string", "email": "string" }
Function: updateUser(req, res)
Error: 400 Bad Request with { "error": "Invalid user data" } for invalid data
Error: 404 Not Found with { "error": "User not found" } if user doesn't exist
Delete a User

Endpoint: DELETE /users/:id
Response: 204 No Content
Function: deleteUser(req, res)
Error: 404 Not Found with { "error": "User not found" } if user doesn't exist
Continue these steps for Task, Category, and Priority Management. Just change the payload and response formats to match the specific requirements of each module. For example, for tasks, you might have a payload like { "title": "string", "description": "string", "category": "string", "priority": "string" }.

Task-User Assignment
Assign a Task to a User

Endpoint: POST /assignments
Payload: { "userId": "string", "taskId": "string" }
Response: 201 Created with { "id": "generatedId", "userId": "string", "taskId": "string" }
Function: assignTask(req, res)
Error: 400 Bad Request with { "error": "Invalid assignment data" } for invalid data
Error: 404 Not Found with { "error": "User or task not found" } if user or task doesn't exist
Unassign a Task from a User

Endpoint: DELETE /assignments/:id
Response: 204 No Content
Function: unassignTask(req, res)
Error: 404 Not Found with { "error": "Assignment not found" } if assignment doesn't exist
Get All Tasks Assigned to a User

Endpoint: GET /assignments/:userId
Response: 200 OK with [ { "id": "string", "userId": "string", "taskId": "string" }, ... ]
Function: getUserTasks(req, res)
Error: 404 Not Found with { "error": "User not found" } if user doesn't exist
Use the joi library for payload validation and make sure to catch all errors in a global error handling middleware. Log all errors and rethrow them as HTTP responses. For instance, invalid payload data should result in a 400 Bad Request response, while trying to manipulate a non-existent resource should result in a 404 Not Found response.

Each endpoint function should be implemented in its own controller file. Use express.Router to modularize the endpoints. Create a middleware for logging all requests and responses. Log the HTTP method, the URL, the status code, the request payload, and the response payload (if any).

Use Postman or CURL to test your API endpoints. Remember to check both the success and error cases. Each endpoint should work as expected and return the correct status code and response. For POST and PUT requests, make sure to send the correct data in the body of the request.
